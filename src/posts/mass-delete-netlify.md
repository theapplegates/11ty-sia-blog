I have a lot of sites that are practically useless. Through time I have gathered quite a few sites. I needed a way to mass delete sites.
A quick Google search and I found this.

Fork the repo and add your OAuth application keys and presto, you get a list  of your sites with an "X" next to them. Hit the "X" and the site is gone.

Now let's see if I can add a "Select All" button.
