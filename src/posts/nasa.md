A summary provided by [NASA](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/Gallery/JWST.html)

>The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST) is a large, infrared-optimized space telescope. The project is working to a 2021 launch date. Webb will find the first galaxies that formed in the early Universe, connecting the Big Bang to our own Milky Way Galaxy. Webb will peer through dusty clouds to see stars forming planetary systems, connecting the Milky Way to our own Solar System. Webb's instruments are designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range. Webb will have a large primary mirror, 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter and a sunshield the size of a tennis court. Both the mirror and sunshade won't fit onto the Ariane 5 rocket fully open, so both will fold up and open once Webb is in outer space. Webb will operate in an orbit about 1.5 million km (1 million miles) from the Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope was named after the NASA Administrator who crafted the Apollo program, and who was a staunch supporter of space science.
Pretty big. So big it had to fold up to fly.

Some facts about the often delayed James Webb Telescope which finally launched December 24, 2021.
1.
Webb’s unprecedented sensitivity to infrared light will help astronomers understand how galaxies assemble over billions of years.
2.
Webb will see through dust clouds, where stars and planetary systems are born.
In addition to learning about our own solar system, Webb will study atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars.
3.
Webb will orbit the Sun at the second Lagrange point, called L2, which is located one million miles from Earth.
4.
Webb’s sunshield is the size of a tennis court. It protects the sensitive equipment by creating a difference in temperature between the hot and cold sides of the spacecraft of almost 600 degrees Fahrenheit!

A test.
