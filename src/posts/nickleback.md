I heard a Nickelback song today and it got me thinking, why does everyone hate [Nickelback](https://medium.com/the-riff/why-does-everyone-hate-nickelback-ceb2177c19ca)?
TLDR:
Why is Nickelback so hated?

I also think that their music being very commercial and mediocre probably contributed to their bad reputation. However, I think Nickelback is hated mainly as a scapegoat and as a result of mob mentality in the digital age.

My conclusion is that Nickelback is hated for the sake of hating something. They’re not particularly offensive and they’re no more mediocre than lots of music on the radio. They were just low hanging fruit, and hating Nickelback became a fun group activity that everyone could be in on.
